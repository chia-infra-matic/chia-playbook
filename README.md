# chia-playbook
## Intro

Hello there! If you reached this page you are probably looking for something to allow you to manage your Chia and Chia's Forks farmers in a more efficient and automated way. Because you probable noticed that there are a lot of new forks and it's getting complicated to manage them at the same time.
Lets assume you have a single host with your plots mounted. You can use this playbook to keep your forks up to date.
Suppose you have a more complex infrastructure. You have one host with farmers and other one with your plots. You can automatically configure your farmer (as a primary host) and you can also automatically configure your harvester to join your main farmer).
So i think you are going to enjoy this Ansible Playbook. And I know it because you are going to perform most common operations with a little of initial setup.
